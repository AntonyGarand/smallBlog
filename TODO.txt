TODO as of 28/09/15


[DONE 29/09/15 - Antony Garand]
Adapt the current theme into a php includeable form:
    preHtml.inc.php
    header.inc.php
    [regular content]
    footer.inc.php
	[EXTRA]
	Adapt the sidebar which is currently hardcoded, maybe find something to go in it?

Adapt the css, js and images to the includes folder

[DONE 03/10/15 - Antony Garand]
Define the documents in the menu:
    Sample folder:
	[facebook]
		[private messaging]
			text.md
			[media]
				ui.png
				messages.png
		[adding a friend]
			text.md
			[media]
				ui.png
				profile.png

[DONE 03/10/15 - Antony Garand]
Must be recursively defined with our code:
    [Menu] -> [Submenu1] [Submenu2] ...
    [facebook] -> [private messageing] [adding a friend]

Opening a post:
	Create a posts.php
	edit the .htaccess to redirect /post/stuff/here to /post.php?id=stuff/here/
	Write the post using the content from ./posts/(id value)
	Convert from markdown to content:
		Suggested converter:

Make the theme a lot nicer:
    Playing with css only, the layout is fine as is.
