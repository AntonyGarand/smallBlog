TODO as of 28/09/15

Adapt the current theme into a php includeable form:
    preHtml.inc.php
    header.inc.php
    [regular content]
    footer.inc.php

Adapt the css, js and images to the includes folder

Define the documents in the menu:
    Sample folder:
    
    [facebook]
        [private messaging]
        text.md
        [images]
            ui.png
            messages.png
        [adding a friend]
        text.md
            ui.png
            profile.png
    [
            
    
Must be recursively defined with our code:
    [Menu] -> [Submenu1] [Submenu2] ...
    [facebook] -> [private messageing] [adding a friend]

Convert from markdown to content:

Make the theme a lot nicer:
    Playing with css only, the layout is fine as is.
